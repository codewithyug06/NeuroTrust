# 🛡️ NeuroTrust
### *We don't secure devices. We secure reality.*


**NeuroTrust** is a multimodal AI defense infrastructure designed to restore human agency in a post-truth world. By combining cryptographic identity verification with real-time deepfake forensics and autonomous interception, we provide a "Cognitive Firewall" that protects users from AI-driven deception and emotional exploitation.

## 🚨 The Problem
We are entering an era where anyone can be impersonated with high fidelity. AI deepfakes and voice clones are weaponizing human emotions to facilitate fraud:
* **Emotional Exploitation:** Parents receiving calls that sound exactly like their children in distress.
* **Corporate Fraud:** CEOs appearing on video to authorize urgent, fraudulent actions.
* **The Trust Gap:** Current security protects passwords and devices but leaves human judgment vulnerable to synthetic manipulation.

---

## ✨ Our Solution: The Trust Engine
NeuroTrust implements a multilayered approach to verify digital authenticity:

* 🆔 **Identity Verification:** Employs **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** for background cryptographic identity handshakes.
* 👁️ **Reality Check:** Utilizes **Azure AI Vision & Speech** to scan for deepfake shimmering, synthetic artifacts, and frequency inconsistencies.
* 🤖 **Guardian AI:** Powered by **GPT-4o**, this autonomous agent intercepts suspicious intent and challenges unknown callers before they reach the user.
* 🌐 **Collective Intelligence:** Logs threat signatures to **Microsoft Fabric**, instantly "vaccinating" the entire global network against new fraud swarms.
* 🛂 **AI Agent Accountability:** Forces synthetic systems to prove their origin and authorization before interaction.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

NeuroTrust is built on a "Layers of Truth" strategy powered by the **Microsoft Cloud Stack**:

1.  **The Edge (Frontend):** A **React Native** application that captures encrypted biometric streams through an inclusive interface.
2.  **The Orchestrator:** A **FastAPI** backend hosted on **Azure App Service** managing real-time model routing.
3.  **The Verification Core:**
    * **Azure AI Vision:** Forensic pixel analysis for facial authenticity.
    * **Azure AI Speech:** Detection of synthetic frequency signatures in audio.
4.  **The Security Layer:** **Azure AI Content Safety** (Prompt Shields) to prevent manipulation of the Guardian AI.
5.  **The Intelligence Layer:** **Microsoft Fabric (OneLake)** providing real-time global threat telemetry and analytics.

## 📈 Business & Sustainability
Our B2B2C model is designed for commercial viability and long-term defensibility:
* **Enterprise Security (45%):** Protecting high-value targets and corporate executives.
* **Consumer Premium (25%):** Advanced "Family Shield" protection plans.
* **Trust APIs (15%):** Allowing third-party platforms to integrate NeuroTrust verification.
* **AI Agent Certification (15%):** Revenue from developers verifying their AI agents' reputations.

---

## 🌍 Social Impact & Diversity
NeuroTrust is built on the principle that digital safety should be accessible to all:
* **Protecting the Vulnerable:** Specialized "Elderly Mode" to shield non-technical users from emotional scams.
* **Human-First Design:** Simple, explainable, and accessible interface for all skill levels.
* **Privacy by Default:** Zero biometric hoarding policy; we verify identity without unnecessary data collection.

---

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Validation):** Azure OpenAI integration, user pilot launch, and Imagine Cup finals.
* **Phase 2 (Technical Scaling):** Deployment of **Microsoft Fabric** global intelligence and release of Enterprise SDKs.
* **Phase 3 (Market Leadership):** Establishing a global trust protocol and partnering with cyber-insurance providers.
